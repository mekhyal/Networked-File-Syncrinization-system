Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
===============================
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is an error-detecting code widely used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. A CRC-enabled transmitter processes a message block, attaches the CRC checksum, and sends the data. The receiver recomputes the CRC and compares it to the transmitted checksum. If they differ, an error is detected.

How CRC Works
-------------
1. The data block is treated as a polynomial and divided by a predetermined generator polynomial.
2. The remainder of this division becomes the CRC code.
3. The code is appended to the original data for transmission.

Typical Use Cases
-----------------
- Ethernet frames
- Storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs)
- File transfer protocols

Advantages and Limitations
--------------------------
CRCs are very good at detecting common transmission errors (burst errors), but they are not cryptographic hashes and should not be used for security purposes.
